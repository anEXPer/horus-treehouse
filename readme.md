# Treehouse Readme

This is my solution to the first exercise in the book
[_Hands-on Rust_](https://github.com/thebracket/HandsOnRust).
I believe it's a little better than the one in the book.

As my first learning project with Rust,
I'm somewhat limited by what the book presents.

I tried to figure out tests, and found the effort holding me back.
So I made `future_tests.md` so I could write down test cases.
This let me stop oscillating and progress.

As of this writing, I'm done with the book chapter about this project.
I'm about to start another simple project from _Command-Line Rust_.
I picked that because it is educational material that encompasses tests.

If I come back to this project, it will be to add tests,
or maybe to re-write it from the test list using TDD.

The future_tests.md directory is also where I am keeping track of bugs.

Similarly, I know Rust's error handling is of special interest,
and that's a special interest of mine.
But it's not in my material yet.
I'm trying very hard to progress through full material right now.

Sometimes it's enough to write about constraints.

The code runs with the default `cargo run` and lints with `cargo clippy`.
I have run these frequently along with my manual test cases,
seeking the fast feedback I prefer,
with the tools I'm constrained to.
