# Future Tests

I don't know how to do tests well at this point,
and it is a distraction to try.

But I do know the tests I run each time I make a change,
that I would like to automate:

Cases:
1. The user is not on the list -> Apology Message
2. The user is on the list -> custom greeting
3. Bare newline/no input -> exit
