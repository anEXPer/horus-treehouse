# Future Tests

I don't know how to do tests well at this point,
and it is a distraction to try.

But I do know the tests I run each time I make a change,
that I would like to automate:

Cases:
1. The user is not on the list -> add to list with standard greeting, no exit,
    a. User was added, -> standard greeting, no exit
2. The user started on the list -> custom greeting, no exit
3. Bare newline/no input -> exit
4. On exit, print final visitor list
